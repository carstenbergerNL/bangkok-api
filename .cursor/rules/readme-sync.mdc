# Always Update READMEs When Things Change

**Rule: whenever you add, change, or remove code, config, or features, update the relevant README so it stays accurate.** Do this in the same change set as the code—not later.

## Which README to update

- **Root `README.md`** – API/solution/database (api/), repo overview, backend config, SQL, health, middleware.
- **`app/README.md`** – Frontend (app/): structure, setup, env vars, scripts, features, API usage.

If a change affects both (e.g. new API endpoint used by the app), update both.

## What triggers an update

| Change type | Update this README | Sections to touch |
|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| New/removed/renamed **API endpoint** or controller | Root README.md | API overview, endpoint table, examples |
| New **project** or folder in **api/** solution | Root README.md | Solution structure, folder tree |
| New **NuGet package** or backend tech | Root README.md | Tech stack, Features if user-facing |
| New **config** (appsettings, options) | Root README.md | Configuration — key and purpose |
| New **health** endpoint or check | Root README.md | Health endpoints — table and response |
| New **SQL** table/script or schema change | Root README.md | Database — tables list, sql/ scripts |
| New **middleware** or pipeline change | Root README.md | Development — middleware order if relevant |
| New **feature** (e.g. auth flow) in API | Root README.md | Features and related sections above |
| New **frontend** page, feature, or route in **app/** | **app/README.md** | Structure, setup, scripts, Features, API usage |
| New **env var** or script in **app/** | **app/README.md** | Setup, Scripts, env table/description |
| New **dependency** or major change in **app/** | **app/README.md** | Tech stack, Scripts, Prerequisites |

## How to update

- Edit the existing README; preserve structure (tables, headings, code blocks).
- Only change what the code/config now does; leave accurate sections as-is.
- After editing, say briefly what you changed (e.g. "Updated README: added /api/orders and app/README: new Restore section in Features.").
